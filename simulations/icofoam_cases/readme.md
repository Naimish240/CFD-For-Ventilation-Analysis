# **Case Explanation**

## **Introduction**

This folder contains all of the cases that were simulated. They were created in the following order :

1. 1_inlet_1_outlet
2. 3_branch_one_main_pair
3. 2_branch_pair_no_main
4. 2_branch_pair_shifted
5. 3_branch_1_main_shifted_bed
6. 3_branch_shifted_bed_shifted_main_one_out
7. 3_branch_shifted_bed_shifted_main
8. 3_wall_4_ceiling
9. 3_wall_5_ceiling
10. 2_wall_6_ceiling
11. 3_branch_pair_shifted
12. 3_branch_pair_1_outlet_shifted

### **1_inlet_1_outlet**

This is a test case that we used to check if our pipeline (FreeCAD -> Gmsh -> OpenFOAM -> ParaView) works as intended. Once this was verified, we moved on to run the subsequent simulations.
